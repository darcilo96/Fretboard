                <p>
                    There's a lot of diversity when pedals we are talking about, we have been knew the classic tones based on overdrives, chorus, delay, distorsions, expression pedals, etc. Then, Mason Marengella can give us some specifications for some pedals considered
                    as the besties along the years by many recognized guitar players as John Mayer, Eric Clapton, Stevie Ray Vaughan, BB King, Jimmy Hendrix and other many people.<br><br>
                    From pedals Like the classic Tube Screamer by Ibanez, to the recent Amp Simulators like ACS1 by Walrus Audio, we can find a great variaty of sounds tha move the music Industry nowadays.<br><br>
                    Also, can we see that around the world there are many companies who had been trying to replicate a faithful sound of the classic pedals, to give to guitar players the facility of
                    achieve the amp sounds fofr a low cost. However, sometimes it's so dificult to obtain really an equal high quality sound for the lowest cost, without saying that is necessary to have
                    expensive gear for achieve a great sound.<br><br> ¡The magic is in your hands!

                <h2>NEWS</h2><br>
                <p class="paragraphTwo">Pink Floyd's Comfortably Numb features some of the greatest electric guitar work ever put to record. David Gilmour's double helping of guitar solos – voted third best of all time by Guitar World readers last year – are expertly constructed, comprising a flurry of Hendrixian-style blues licks, aggressive double stops and surgically precise whammy bar vibrato, not to mention a tone for the ages.<br><br>
                    It might come as a surprise, then, that the solo we hear from the 4:31 mark was actually Gilmour's first take.<br><br>
                    In an interview in the new issue of Total Guitar, The Wall producer Bob Ezrin recalls being overcome with emotion when Gilmour first played the lead line in the studio.<br><br>
