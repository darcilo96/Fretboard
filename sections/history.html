                    <h2>THE 70's TONE</h2><br>
                    <p>Around 1982 until 1985 the Ibanez pedals were repackaged and the 9-series of effects were made. The most popular was the TS-9 tube screamer,
                    which is almost the same as the TS-808 internally. Externally the on/off switch grew to fill about 1/3 of the effect. The main change in the TS-9
                    circuit is in the output section. This caused the tube screamer to be a bit brighter and less "smooth". The Edge from U2 uses a TS9 for most of his
                    overdrive tones, as do countless other famous rock and blues players. In later years the TS-9s were put together with other op-amp chips, instead of
                    the JRC-4558 which is called for in the schematics. Some of these sound BAD, especially the JRC 2043DD chips. Many used the Toshiba TA75558 which was
                    continued on the reissue. If you have an original TS9 with the 2043 chip, our 808 mods will make a huge difference in tone.</p>

                    <h2>HENDRIX AS A LEGEND</h2><br>
                    <p>The lyrics to “Little Wing” are as mysterious and free-flowing as the song’s guitar melody,
                    with Hendrix singing about this special cosmic woman that he encounters. This woman embodies the
                    wild spirit of mother nature and enters his life as a bright and shining beam, bringing along with
                    her the positivity of her spirit.<br><br>
                    Jimi conjures up the clouds in the intro with a unique flanging to his guitar tone, which is done with
                    the use of a Leslie cabinet. Hendrix was one of the first to use an effect like this, with Buddy Guy coming
                    before him on Junior Wells’ 1965 recording of “Hoodoo Man Blues”, and it has since been used by many guitarists
                    including, of course, Stevie Ray Vaughn as well as Pearl Jam’s Eddie Vedder on the song “Yellow Ledbetter.”</p>
